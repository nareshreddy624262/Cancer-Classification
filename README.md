# Cancer Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on cancer classification, designed to help predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on specific features.

## Project Overview

Cancer classification is a crucial application of machine learning in the healthcare domain, aiming to aid in early cancer detection and diagnosis. This project utilizes supervised learning algorithms to classify tumors based on their characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes features like radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.

- **Features**: 30 real-valued features computed for each cell nucleus
- **Target**: Two possible classes: malignant and benign

## Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**: for model selection, training, and evaluation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: for visualizations

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Feature scaling
   - Data visualization for insight

2. **Model Training**
   - Trained using several algorithms, including:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest

3. **Evaluation**
   - Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate models.
   - Confusion matrix visualization.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimized models using GridSearchCV.

## Results

The model with the highest accuracy was identified and saved for deployment. Overall, this project achieved an accuracy of approximately **XX%** (update with actual results).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/cancer-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the main script to perform predictions:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in medical data analysis and cancer classification. With further improvements, it could be extended for real-world healthcare applications.
